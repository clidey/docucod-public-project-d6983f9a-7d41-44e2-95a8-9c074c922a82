### Quick Validation Steps for GORM MySQL Driver

This guide helps you perform a straightforward validation of your GORM MySQL Driver installation and configuration. You will run a simple code snippet that executes a migration and a basic query to confirm the driver is functioning correctly with your MySQL database.

---

#### 1. Confirm Your Environment is Ready
Before running any tests, ensure you have:

- Installed the GORM MySQL Driver via Go modules.
- A reachable MySQL database instance (MySQL 5.6+, MariaDB, or TiDB).
- Proper DSN (Data Source Name) configured with appropriate credentials and connection parameters.

You can review prerequisite and installation steps in the [Installation](./installation) and [Basic Configuration](./basic-configuration) guides.

---

#### 2. Prepare a Minimal Test Program
Create a new Go file (e.g., `validation_test.go`) and use the following template to validate the driver:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/driver/mysql"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

// User represents a simple database model for testing migration
type User struct {
  ID   uint   `gorm:"primaryKey"`
  Name string
}

func main() {
  dsn := "gorm:gorm@tcp(localhost:9910)/gorm?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local" // replace with your DSN
  db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to connect database: %v", err))
  }

  // Run auto-migration for the User model
  if err := db.AutoMigrate(&User{}); err != nil {
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("migration failed: %v", err))
  }

  fmt.Println("Migration completed successfully.")

  // Create a new user record
  db.Create(&User{Name: "Test User"})

  // Query the user back
  var user User
  if err := db.First(&user).Error; err != nil {
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("query failed: %v", err))
  }

  fmt.Printf("User found: ID=%d, Name=%s\n", user.ID, user.Name)
}
```

#### 3. Run the Test Program

Execute your test program:

```bash
go run validation_test.go
```

##### Expected Output:

```text
Migration completed successfully.
User found: ID=1, Name=Test User
```

This output confirms:

- The driver can open a valid connection using your DSN.
- Migration commands are executed, creating the required tables.
- Basic CRUD operations succeed.

---

#### 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter errors:

- **Connection Errors:** Verify your DSN syntax, ensure the MySQL server is running and accessible.
- **Authentication Failures:** Confirm username, password, and privileges.
- **Migration Errors:** Check MySQL version compatibility; review logs for missing permissions.
- **Timeout or Network Issues:** Confirm network settings and firewall rules.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](./troubleshooting) page for detailed help.

#### 5. Next Steps

After successful validation:

- Proceed to explore more advanced configurations in the [Basic Configuration](./basic-configuration) guide.
- Connect your actual application to the database using GORM MySQL driver.
- For custom driver scenarios, see the [Using a Customized MySQL Driver](./custom-driver-usage) documentation.
