# First Database Connection with GORM MySQL Driver

Welcome to the first crucial step in using the GORM MySQL Driver: **connecting your Go application to a MySQL database**. This guide walks you through the essential steps with clear, copy-paste ready examples to help you get a verified connection instantly. You will learn how to substitute your own database credentials, understand the key parts of the connection string (DSN), and verify a successful connection.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Before connecting, ensure that you have:

- A running MySQL server accessible from your Go application environment
- Database user credentials with proper privileges
- Network connectivity between your app and the MySQL server
- Installed the GORM MySQL driver module (`gorm.io/driver/mysql`) and GORM core (`gorm.io/gorm`)


## 2. Constructing Your Data Source Name (DSN)

The DSN is a critical string that contains the necessary information for MySQL connection. Its general format is:

```plaintext
username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

Typical example:

```plaintext
gorm:gorm@tcp(localhost:9910)/gorm?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local
```

Breakdown:

- `gorm:gorm` — username and password
- `tcp(localhost:9910)` — network protocol and server address with port
- `/gorm` — database name
- Query parameters like `charset`, `parseTime`, and `loc` configure connection details

**Tip:** Refer to the official DSN syntax detailed in the [go-sql-driver/mysql documentation](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name) for advanced options.


## 3. Import Required Packages

Start by importing the GORM core and the MySQL driver packages in your Go code:

```go
import (
  "gorm.io/driver/mysql"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)
```


## 4. Open the Database Connection

Use the `mysql.Open` method to specify your DSN, and then open the GORM connection as shown:

```go
func main() {
  dsn := "gorm:gorm@tcp(localhost:9910)/gorm?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local" // Replace with your DB credentials

  db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect database: " + err.Error())
  }

  // Connection successful
  fmt.Println("Successfully connected to the MySQL database!")
}
```

### Key Notes:
- Replace `gorm:gorm@tcp(localhost:9910)/gorm` with your own `username:password@network(address)/database`.
- Maintain query parameters like `parseTime=True` to ensure time values are parsed correctly.
- Handle errors gracefully to catch connection issues early.


## 5. Verify Connection

Once the `gorm.Open` call returns without error, you have an active GORM DB session.

For an extra layer of verification, you can ping the database:

```go
sqlDB, err := db.DB()
if err != nil {
  panic("failed to get raw DB: " + err.Error())
}

err = sqlDB.Ping()
if err != nil {
  panic("failed to ping database: " + err.Error())
}

fmt.Println("Database ping successful!")
```


## 6. Example: Full Minimal Program

Here is a minimal but complete example you can run after replacing the DSN:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/driver/mysql"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
  dsn := "username:password@tcp(host:3306)/database?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local"

  db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect to database: " + err.Error())
  }

  sqlDB, err := db.DB()
  if err != nil {
    panic("failed to get database object: " + err.Error())
  }

  if err = sqlDB.Ping(); err != nil {
    panic("database ping failed: " + err.Error())
  }

  fmt.Println("Connected and verified successfully!")
}
```


## 7. Troubleshooting Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Connection Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Incorrect DSN format or credentials">
- Verify username, password, host, port, and database name correctness.
- Use the official DSN syntax reference for formatting.
- Ensure no extra spaces or illegal characters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MySQL server not reachable">
- Check if the MySQL server is running.
- Validate that network and firewall settings allow traffic on the port.
- Confirm the address and port in DSN match your server.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient privileges">
- Ensure the user has appropriate permissions to connect and operate.
- Use `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'host';` directly on the MySQL server.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Time parsing failed or incorrect timezone">
- Use the `parseTime=True` in your DSN query string.
- Match `loc=Local` or appropriate timezone to your environment.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If you experience connection timeout, try increasing your MySQL server’s `wait_timeout` or adjust Go’s database/sql connection pool settings.
