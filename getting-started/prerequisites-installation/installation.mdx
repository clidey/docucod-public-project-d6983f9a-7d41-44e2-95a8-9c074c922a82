# Installation Guide for GORM MySQL Driver

This guide walks you through the process of installing the GORM MySQL Driver using Go modules. Whether you are setting up on a single platform or managing multi-platform development environments, follow these steps to get the driver ready for your Go applications.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Go version**: 1.15 or higher is required to use Go modules effectively.
- **MySQL Server**: Ensure your MySQL server is version 5.6 or newer (including MariaDB and TiDB variants).
- **Network Access**: Your development machine should be able to reach the MySQL server.

If you haven't already validated your environment, see the [Prerequisites](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/prerequisites) page for detailed requirements.

## 2. Installing the GORM MySQL Driver

### 2.1 Single-Platform Installation

If you are working on a single platform (e.g., Linux, macOS, or Windows), installing the GORM MySQL Driver is straightforward.

Open your terminal at your Go project root and run:

```bash
go get gorm.io/driver/mysql
```

This command fetches the latest compatible version of the driver and adds it to your project's `go.mod` file.

### 2.2 Multi-Platform Environment Setup

For multi-platform development (cross-compiling or sharing code across various OS/architectures), the above single command will still suffice because Go modules handle dependencies across platforms. Just ensure your `go.mod` file is committed and consistent across environments.

---

## 3. Importing and Verifying Installation

Once installed, update your Go code to import the driver alongside GORM.

Example: 

```go
import (
  "gorm.io/driver/mysql"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
  dsn := "user:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local"

  db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect database")
  }
  // Use db for operations
}
```

Here, the `mysql.Open(dsn)` initializes the MySQL driver with your data source name (DSN).

### DSN Format Reminder

Your DSN must follow the format specified by the underlying Go MySQL driver, for example:

```text
user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local
```

Refer to https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name for detailed DSN configurations.

---

## 4. Confirming Successful Installation

To verify the driver installed correctly and can connect to your MySQL database:

1. Run your application containing the example code above.
2. Ensure no errors occur connecting to the database.
3. Optionally, perform a simple query or ping check:

```go
sqlDB, err := db.DB()
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
if err := sqlDB.Ping(); err != nil {
  panic(err)
}
```

If no panic occurs, the installation and basic connectivity are successful.

### Troubleshooting

- **Error importing `gorm.io/driver/mysql`**: Run `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies.
- **Connection refused or timeout**: Check MySQL server availability and network settings.
- **Go version issues**: Verify your Go version is 1.15+ by running `go version`.

For more troubleshooting tips, consult the [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/configuration-first-run/troubleshooting) documentation.

---

## 5. Additional Installation Tips

- **Custom Driver Name**: If you want to use a custom MySQL driver (e.g., a variant or fork), configure it with the `DriverName` field in the `mysql.Config` struct and pass it to `mysql.New()`.

Example:

```go
import (
  _ "example.com/my_mysql_driver"
  "gorm.io/driver/mysql"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

config := mysql.Config{
  DriverName: "my_mysql_driver_name",
  DSN:       "user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local",
}

db, err := gorm.Open(mysql.New(config), &gorm.Config{})
```

- **Version-Specific Flags**: The driver auto-detects your MySQL (or compatible) version and adjusts its behavior to match features and limitations.

- **Go Modules Best Practice**: Always keep your Go modules updated with `go get -u` to benefit from the latest fixes.

## 6. Next Steps

After successful installation, proceed to:

- Configure your connection options and schema mappings on the [Basic Configuration](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/configuration-first-run/basic-configuration) page.
- Establish your first database connection and run queries via the [First Database Connection](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/configuration-first-run/first-connection) guide.
